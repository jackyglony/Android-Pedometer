# Android Pedometer

Android Pedometer is an Android app that counts the users steps as they navigate through a given SVG map. The app also uses a path finder algorithm to determine a path from the start point to the destination. This app was developed during the lab component of ECE 155: Embedded Systems and Engineering Design at the University of Waterloo. 

On screen the app displays:

* Step Count
* SVG map
* Current location
* Start Location
* Finish Location 
* Path from start to finish
* North and East displacement
* Start/Stop button
* Reset button
